          _{You command powerful magic, not through study or devotion to any ideal,
          but as a vessel or agent for a mysterious, otherworldly patron that even you
          don’t entirely understand. This entity might be a covert divinity, a powerful
          fey, a manifestation of natural energies, an ancient spirit, or any other mighty supernatural
          being—but its nature is likely as much a mystery to you as it is to anyone else. Through a
          special familiar, your patron grants you versatile spells and powerful hexes to use as you see
          fit, though you’re never certain if these gifts will end up serving your patron’s larger plan.}
