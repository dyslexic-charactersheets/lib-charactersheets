          _{You are an eternal student of the arcane secrets of the universe, using your
          mastery of magic to cast powerful and devastating spells. You treat magic like a
          science, cross-referencing the latest texts on practical spellcraft with ancient esoteric tomes
          to discover and understand how magic works. Yet magical theory is vast, and thereâ€™s no
          way you can study it all. You either specialize in one of the eight schools of magic, gaining
          deeper understanding of the nuances of those spells above all others, or favor a broader
          approach that emphasizes the way all magic comes together at the expense of depth.}

          save your most powerful magic to incapacitate threatening foes and use your cantrips
          when only weaker foes remain. When enemies pull out tricks like invisibility or flight,
          you answer with spells like glitterdust or earth bind, leveling the field for your allies}
