              Whether you sought citizenship or simply needed a steady paycheck, you spent some of your time as a paid mercenary in the armed forces of Molthune, where you fought against Molthune's enemies such as Nirmathas or the Ironfang Legion. Alternatively, you might have worked at sea, protecting Molthune's military and trading ships against pirates on Lake Encarthan.
