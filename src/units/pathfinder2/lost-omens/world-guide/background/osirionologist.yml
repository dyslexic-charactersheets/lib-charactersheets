              Whether you're a fascinated outsider or a local proud of your nation's storied past, you're a devoted student of Osirion's history. You might be a traveling professor, a member of a society like the Pathfinders or the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye, or even a simple tomb robber cashing in on the glories of the past.
