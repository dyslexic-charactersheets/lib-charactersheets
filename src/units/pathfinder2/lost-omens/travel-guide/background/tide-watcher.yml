              Where you hail from, the ocean is the lifeblood of your community; knowing how it changes according to the moon was integral to everyday life. You've studied the moon's phases to predict the rise and fall of the ocean waters. Eventually, you gained a supernatural ability to foretell to some degree of accuracy the coming of more severe changes, such as tidal waves or encroaching storms. At times, it fell on you to warn settlements of such oncoming natural disasters.
