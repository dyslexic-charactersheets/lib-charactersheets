              You were born under a powerful manifestation of a specific constellation, and its connection to you is obvious. You tend to feel most at ease while your constellation is prominent and can draw upon your sign's influence from time to time. When you gain this background, choose a specific constellation, such as the Thrush or the Wagon. Your associated constellation determines one of the ability boosts you gain and an innate spell. The list includes benefits for the constellations of the Cosmic Caravan, but you might have been born under a different constellation and gain different benefits as determined by the GM.
