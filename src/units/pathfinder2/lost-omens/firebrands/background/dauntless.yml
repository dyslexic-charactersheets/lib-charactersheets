              As a child, you chose to face each of your deepest fears and, time and again, emerged victorious. You have learned to conquer fear itself, and by sheer force of will and determination, you're able to brush off frightening experiences more easily than most. Others find it difficult to intimidate you into backing down from whatever you've set your mind to.
