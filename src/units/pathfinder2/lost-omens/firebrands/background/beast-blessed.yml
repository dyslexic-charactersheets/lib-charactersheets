              You once freed a magical beast from captivity and, whether it was intentional or a byproduct of another action, the grateful creature bestowed a blessing of freedom upon you. Your blessing manifests physically, perhaps as elongated canines, fingernails that grow to a sharp point, excess body hair, or some other feature. This physical manifestation is cosmetic and provides no benefit.
