          protected from wild creatures. Others say nature needs to be protected from
          the greedy, who wish to tame its beauty and plunder its treasures. You could
          champion either goal, or both. You might be a scout, tracker, or hunter of fugitives or beasts,
          haunting the edge of civilization or exploring the wilds. You know how to live off the land and
          are skilled at spotting and taking down both opportune prey and hated enemies.}
