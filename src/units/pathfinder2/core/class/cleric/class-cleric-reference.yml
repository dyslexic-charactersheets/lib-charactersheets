          of their most stalwart mortal servants. Blessed with divine magic, you live the
          ideals of your faith, adorn yourself with the symbols of your church, and train
          diligently to wield your deity’s favored weapon. Your spells might protect and heal your
          allies, or they might punish foes and enemies of your faith, as your deity wills. Yours is a life
          of devotion, spreading the teachings of your faith through both word and deed.}
