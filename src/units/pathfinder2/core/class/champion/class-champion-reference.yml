          mantle, and you adhere to a code that holds you apart from those around
          you. While champions exist for every alignment, as a champion of good, you
          provide certainty and hope to the innocent. You have powerful defenses that you share freely
          with your allies and innocent bystanders, as well as holy power you use to end the threat of
          evil. Your devotion even attracts the attention of holy spirits who aid you on your journey.}
