          _{You are skilled and opportunistic. Using your sharp wits and quick reactions,
          you take advantage of your opponents’ missteps and strike where it hurts
          most. You play a dangerous game, seeking thrills and testing your skills, and
          likely don’t care much for any laws that happen to get in your way. While the path of
          every rogue is unique and riddled with danger, the one thing you all share in common is
          the breadth and depth of your skills.}
