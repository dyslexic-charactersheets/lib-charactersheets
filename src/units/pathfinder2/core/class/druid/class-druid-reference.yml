          _{The power of nature is impossible to resist. It can bring ruin to the stoutest
          fortress in minutes, reducing even the mightiest works to rubble, burning them
          to ash, burying them beneath an avalanche of snow, or drowning them beneath
          the waves. It can provide endless bounty and breathtaking splendor to those who respect it—
          and an agonizing death to those who take it too lightly. You are one of those who hear nature’s
          call. You stand in awe of the majesty of its power and give yourself over to its service.}

          You cast spells that draw upon primal magic to protect yourself and your friends,
          heal their wounds, or summon deadly animals to fight at your side. Depending on
          your bond to nature, you might call upon powerful elemental magic or change shape
          into a terrifying beast.}

          that not only are best for the natural world, but also allow the creatures within it to
          live in harmony and peace. You often propose compromises that allow both sides to
          gain what they truly need, even if they can’t have all that they desire.}
