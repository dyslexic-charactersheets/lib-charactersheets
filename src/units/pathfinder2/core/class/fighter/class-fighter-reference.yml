          _{Fighting for honor, greed, loyalty, or simply the thrill of battle, you are an
          undisputed master of weaponry and combat techniques. You combine your
          actions through clever combinations of opening moves, finishing strikes, and
          counterattacks whenever your foes are unwise enough to drop their guard. Whether you
          are a knight, mercenary, sharpshooter, or blade master, you have honed your martial skills
          into an art form and perform devastating critical attacks on your enemies.}
