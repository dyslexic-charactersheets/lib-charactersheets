              You came to Alkenstar because you heard they had guns, but you stayed because of the atmosphere. Or the guns. Either way, journalism and scientific curiosity opened the door to a life of adventure. Now you continue to adventure in the Alkenstar area, using your skills to deal with whatever situations present themselves.
