              Through bloody combat, a terrible accident, or purposeful sacrifice, you've lost some piece of your body that has been replaced with a clockwork mechanism. Whether your arm is now a whirring series of pumps, steel coils, and iron gears; your heart a intricate crystal clock that requires winding every day; or your lower leg a sculpted metal tube powered by adamantine springs and steam, part of you needs regular maintenance and repair. You might have received instructions from the brilliant inventor who saved you, or you might have woken up on a battlefield with no memory of the procedure or the individuals involved. Regardless, you possess the knowledge to take care of yourself-even if it's how to wind a key in your own heart or reconstruct a mechanical foot.
