              While others choose to use their engineering ability to heal the injured or make brilliant innovations, you've used your skill to repair and modify clockwork constructs that battle in gladiatorial combat. You know how to get a crowd electrified for your clockwork gladiator, win or lose, and you know how to repair it when it gets damaged. These skills serve you well as an adventurer.
