              You were among the Pathfinders recruited by the devious Shadow Lodge, lured in by promises of wealth, reform, justice, or revenge. You might have fought against the Society's loyal agents, helped sabotage the Pathfinders' reputation in distant countries, or even infiltrated the far-flung lodges as a spy. You've since made peace with and rejoined the Pathfinder Society, yet the underhanded reflexes and skills you learned are hard to forget.
