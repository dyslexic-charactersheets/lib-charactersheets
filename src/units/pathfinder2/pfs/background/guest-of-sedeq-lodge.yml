              Either as a guest, event staff, or part of the construction crew, you spent a significant stretch of time at the Pathfinder Society's new lodge in Sedeq. The lodge serves as a new home for those fleeing from oppression or otherwise seeking a fresh start in Qadira. The magic and marvels you witnessed at the lodge inspired you to find more excitement as a member of the Pathfinder Society.
