              You're a trained physician who can ably tend wounds of many kinds. But more than a practitioner, you're a scholar. Some cultures shape flesh to extreme degrees, creating aberrations from humanoid forms. The fleshforges of distant Nex practice this fleshwarping, as do certain subterranean societies you hope to one day studyâ€”preferably from a safe and clinical distance.
