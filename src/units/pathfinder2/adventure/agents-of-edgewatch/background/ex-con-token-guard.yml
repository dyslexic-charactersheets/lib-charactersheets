              Not everyone starts life on easy street-your own experience is testament to that. You took a wrong turn at some point early on and became a career criminal. Perhaps you were a petty pickpocket, or maybe you've even murdered someone. Either way, your crimes landed you with a transformative prison sentence in the Brine prison. Only then did you realize that something needed to change. After your release, you dedicated yourself to helping other downtrodden individuals and those forced to resort to crime to survive. You joined the Coins District Guard, but soon learned that this precinct was a haven for the very corruption you sought to undo. Your efforts at reform never took root and you feared that your decision to become an officer of the law was a huge mistake.
