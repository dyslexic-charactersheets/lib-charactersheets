              The Harbor Guard isn't known for being the most honorable precinct in town. A few years after you joined the force, you became disillusioned by the rampant corruption within the precinct and the district at large. One night, you stumbled on an ad for a local monster hunter's guild. You joined on a whim, but fell in love with the swashbuckling lifestyle of an independent bounty hunter. You've since earned quite a reputation for your nocturnal adventures; everyone still knows that you're a Harbor Guard, but stories of your dungeon-delving adventures have long overshadowed that facet of your life. Unfortunately, long nights of monster-hunting have negatively impacted your performance at your day job, so maybe it wasn't a surprise when your supervising officer put in a transfer request for you, spelling the end of your plucky nighttime antics with that particular guild.
