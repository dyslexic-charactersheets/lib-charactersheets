              You helped to build and design buildings and public works on behalf of Geb's architectural faction, the Builders League. You've been taught that creating bridges, gatehouses, roads, walls, and more is as much about planning as it is about brute labor. You learned that the Builders League has plans of occult significance for many of its construction projects and might have even aided them in the way you laid stones or designed walls (although you never learned the great design behind those secret plans). Although you've left construction behind, the skills in long-term planning and leveraging effort remain with you.
