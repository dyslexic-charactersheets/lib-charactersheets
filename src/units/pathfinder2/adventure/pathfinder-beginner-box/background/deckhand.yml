You might have worked on a simple fishing boat, a wealthy merchant's galley, a mighty warship—or even a pirate's caravel. Whether your crew retired, your ship sank, or you've turned to adventuring so you can keep all the treasure for yourself, you still retain an excellent sense of balance and quick reflexes.}"
