              You have lived all your life in and around the city of Restov, growing up on tales of Baron Sirian Aldori and the exploits of your home's heroic and legendary swordlords. Joining an expedition into the Stolen Lands seems like a perfect way to improve your skills and begin crafting a legend worthy of Baron Aldori.
