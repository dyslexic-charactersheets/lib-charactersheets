              You're skilled at shouting to catch and keep the attention of passersby. A few well-timed and forcefully spoken words not only get people to notice you but also engage them to respond to you. You may have previously worked as a crier or in a more formal barker capacity with Mistress Dusklight's Celestial Menagerie. Either way, your ability to bully a crowd is impressive.
