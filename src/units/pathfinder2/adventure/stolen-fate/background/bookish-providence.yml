              You have always been interested in knowledge and learned to read from a very young age. Perhaps one or both of your parents were librarians or scholars, or maybe the local bookshop or university was a place you felt safe at. Or, you could simply have been an avid reader of stories. Whatever the case, books have always brought you peace and comfort, and you try to never travel without a few packed away in your belongings. Since not every book is written in the same language, you've also picked up a few extra languages along the way. Your interest in the written word hasn't always been a positive, though. You might have been bullied or tormented by your peers for being more interested in reading than other pursuits. Or maybe you had some unsettling experiences with misinformation or knowledge that sent you in pursuit of something dangerous. Try to come up with one event from your past where your pursuit of books or the testing of knowledge learned from them placed you in danger, but also keep in mind that you managed to escape this danger because of what you've learned from your voracious reading habits!
