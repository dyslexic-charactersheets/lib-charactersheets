              Destiny has always intrigued you. Maybe you grew up in a family where fortune-telling and divinations were a day-to-day part of life, or perhaps you had your fortune told as a young adult and the results were so shockingly accurate that you became a believer. The mysteries of what might lie in store for us all have long intrigued you, and you're always eager to debate whether or not we have free will or if destiny is predeterminedâ€”be it for one side or the other. You may see the failure of prophecy that began with the onset of the Age of Lost Omens as a dire indication of some sort of horrible cosmic mistake. Conversely, you could view this age as new era of freedom where reality is finally admitting that each person is free to determine their own path to the future. You still own a small token from your childhood that you view as a lucky charm, but whatever your beliefs are today, many of your fortunes have foretold that great things lie in store for you in the future, and you can't wait to find out what they might be!
