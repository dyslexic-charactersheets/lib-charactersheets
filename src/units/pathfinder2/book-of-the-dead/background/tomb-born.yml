              Your parents conceived you for a fell purpose at a site tainted by death, like a wight's barrow, mass grave, or ossuary. Their reasons could be a mystery, or you might know of their grand design and seek to escape-or fulfill-their plans. Either way, you're at your most dangerous when near death.
